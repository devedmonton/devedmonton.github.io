## August 16-17th 2019

**TICKETS FOR 2019 ARE SOLD OUT**

DevelopEd brings Edmonton's developer community together to solve problems that matter. Built with the spirit of inclusivity, the event encourages developers and community members of all backgrounds and skill levels to do great things together.

This unique face-to-face venue is a spring board to kickstart new sustainable projects throughout the rest of the year. Success will be measured in terms of what was accomplished, not what was planned or discussed, so come prepared to roll up your sleeves!

A huge thank you to DotDash and all our other [generous sponsors](#sponsors), without whom this event wouldn't be possible!

## TLDR;

*Get passionate, then [be ready to pitch your project](#prepare-your-pitch) and join a team Saturday morning.*

*[Bring a laptop](#what-to-bring), [join Slack](https://devedmonton-invite.herokuapp.com/), and [get on the WiFi](#get-on-the-wifi).*

*Be kind. Be patient. Be open. Read the [Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct.html).*

*Talk to an organizer if you have a question or are in distress.*

### Format

This is a new kind of event for organizers and attendees, which we're tentatively calling an **OrgJam**.

Friday night attendees gather, socialize and start planning, then Saturday we pitch ideas and hit the ground running. After a long day spent building awesome projects, we gather in the evening to share and celebrate our creations!

### Important Times

*All events are taking place at [Startup Edmonton](https://goo.gl/maps/6Pv1Bt1pSftNvSxY9), located at 10359 104 St NW, unit #301*

## When You Arrive

When you first arrive, there are a few things to know.

#### Check In

To your left as you reach the top of the stairs in the Mercer Building, you'll see the check in desk. There should be someone waiting there to great you, so say hello and collect your name tag!

To make everyone feel welcome, we also supply optional pronoun stickers for your name tag. Blue means he/him, red for she/her, and green means check my name tag or ask.

Along with this, we've got the yellow stickers. If you're comfortable with the [code of conduct](/code_of_conduct.html) and are okay with people asking you for help, or just striking up a friendly conversation then stick one of these on. If you're attending an event for the first time, have a question, or want to chat, then someone with a yellow dot is there to talk. Please remember, if you're in distress or it's an emergency to contact an event organizer.

Once you're checked in, head on to the social space!

#### Share Your Pitch

As you arrive, it's time to start thinking about your pitch and the project you'd like to champion. When you're ready find a piece of paper and some tape, then stick your idea up on pitch wall so people can vote on it. We'll also set aside some brief time on Saturday morning for you to share a one-minute pitch in person.

#### Get On The WiFi

We all know that WiFi is essential at events like these, and Startup Edmonton now has a solid fibre optic connection ready!

**SSID:** Startup_Edmonton  
**PASS:** Community1

Let one of the event organizers know if you're having trouble getting online.

#### Say Hello (Slack / Social Media)

Once you're settled, say hello to the other attendees! Don't forget to [join us on Slack](https://devedmonton-invite.herokuapp.com/)!

If you're into social media please use the hashtag #developed2019.

#### Bathrooms & Services

Bathrooms are located just off the kitchen in the north east corner of the space. Ask an organizer if you need help finding them.

#### Sticker Table

Did we mention there will be stickers? So as not to crowd the venue we'll provide a special table for sharing and swapping stickers. Bring some for your friends!
